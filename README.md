## Usage Permissions 

### Modpacks

Any of my mods may be freely included in Modpacks without express permission. Attribution is not required, but encouraged. I ask that you don't use the name of the mod in the Modpack.

### Recording and Posting

Any of my mods may be recorded and posted in any videos or other formats on all platforms that allow Minecraft to be posted. Please do not miscredit any mods featured in the video, or link to unauthorized re-posting sites (i.e. 9minecraft) in your media.

### Republishing

Please do not publicly republish my mods on any platform without express permission from me. Viewing and modifying my code is allowed and encouraged, as long as you are not publicly publishing the code or any assets associated with it. If you are looking for my mods on a platform, and they are not there, feel free contact me.

## Forge (Legacy) Disclaimer

Starting with version 1.20.4-2.4.2, Instrumentus will exclusively be releasing feature and Minecraft Version updates on NeoForge. Please _**do not ask me**_ to port the mod to a later version of forge. I will consider PRs for later forge updates, please do not Fork and redistribute as a Forge mod, I would rather it all be included under the Instrumentus name. If someone is interested in regularly maintaining the forge version, feel free to reach out, but due to my feelings on the whole Forge-NeoForge situation, I'll only be working on NeoForge.
