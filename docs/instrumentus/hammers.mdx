Hammers are a mining tool that allows the user to break blocks in a 3x3 block square around the targeted block. The blocks you will mine will be highlighted, not just the block you are targeting. The hammer can break any block that a pickaxe can. The ranged block breaking only works on blocks the tool is effective on.
