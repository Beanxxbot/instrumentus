Excavators are a digging tool that allows the user to break blocks in a 3x3 block square around the targeted block. The blocks you will mine will be highlighted, not just the block you are targeting. The excavator can break any block that a shovel can. The ranged block breaking only works on blocks the tool is effective on.

### Materials

Currently, you can craft a Hammer using the following tool materials:
* Wood
* Stone
* [Copper](/mod/instrumentus/docs/coppertools)
* Iron
* Gold
* Diamond
* Netherite
* [Energized Di-Emerald](/mod/instrumentus/docs/energized)

### Crafting

Excavators can be crafted by following the pattern below, replacing the diamond block with the corresponding block from the materials listed above
