Instrumentus is highly configurable, allowing you to enable and disable features via the Configuration File. Doing so will disable the recipes associated with the feature.

## How to use the Configuration File

To enable or disable features in Instrumentus, you'll need to navigate to the `config` folder of your Minecraft Instance, and then open up the file titled `instrumentus-common.toml`. The file should looks something like the file below.

```toml
#Enable/Disable the Various Tools included in the Mod
[tools]
	#Hammers mine in a 3x3 radius, made of every single tool material
	enable_hammers = true
	#Sickles mass harvest leaf and tall-grass blocks, their range increases the higher the tool level
	enable_sickles = true
	#Material variants for iron shears (Wood-Netherite)
	enable_shears = true
	#The original item in the mod! Paxels are a tool able to mine all blocks that an Axe, Pickaxe and Shovel Can
	enable_paxels = true
	#Soulcopper items currently present in instrumentus is the Soul-Infused Pickaxe, which places light blocks on right click
	enable_soulcopper = true
	#RF-Powered tools made of diamonds, emeralds and redstone. This will also disable carbon rods.
	enable_energized = true
	#Knives harvest plant fiber from tall grass, which can be used to make string. Disables Knives as well as plant fiber.
	enable_knives = true
	#Copper Tools that are slower than iron tools, but have three times the durability
	enable_copper = true
	#Brushes made of every tool material, including Instrumentus ones - their speed stays the same, however they have different durabilities
	enable_brushes = true
	#Excavators are 3x3 shovels that can mine a bunch of dirt!
	enable_excavators = true
```
(Sample Config File last updated with Version 1.21.x-2.6.0)

Each line in the Configuration file should have a brief explanation of what each feature does. If you'd like to disable any of these features, replace the `true` with `false`. Please note, that enabling or disabling any of these features requires a **full restart** of your game.
