title: Shears
hide_meta: true
---

Instrumentus adds variants for shears in every tool material. They behave identically to shears, and are capable of shearing sheep, and breaking blocks that shears normally can. Their durability is calculated based on the ratio of the Vanilla Shear's durability to an Iron Tool's Durability. This means that the shears in Instrumentus have a max durability that is 95.2% of a standard tool of that material.

### Materials
Currently, Shears are available in the following materials
* Wood
* Stone
* [Copper](/mod/instrumentus/docs/coppertools)
* Gold
* Diamond
* Netherite
* [Energized Di-Emerald](/mod/instrumentus/docs/energized)

### Crafting

Similarly to Vanilla Shears, the Shears in Instrumentus can be crafting using the pattern below, replacing the diamonds with any of the tool materials listed above.
