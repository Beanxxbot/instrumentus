Soulcopper is a new material with some fun tools associated with it, as well as some new building blocks! Soulcopper is obtained in a vanilla-esque unique way, using the Copper-fueled Soul Campfire.

### Copper-fueled Soul Campfire

This is a new variant of the Soul Campfire that burns a vibrant green. It is the block used to craft the Raw Soulcopper, and the recipe for the campfire can be found below.

Once you place this campfire in the world, you can cook Raw Copper Blocks on it to get pieces of Raw Soulcopper

### Raw Soulcopper

Raw Soulcopper has a few uses. It can be used to craft Soulcopper Torches, as shown by the recipe below.

The Soulcopper Torch has a vibrant green flame, and can burn underwater!

The Soulcopper Torch can also be crafted into a Lantern, the same way you craft the vanilla Lantern and Soul Lantern

It can also be crafted into the Raw Soulcopper Block, the same way all other raw ore blocks are crafted, for a new unique looking block that actually emits light!

Finally, Raw Soulcopper can be smelted in a Blast Furnace (no other furnace block will work) to make Soulcopper Ingots

### Soulcopper Ingots

Soulcopper Ingots are used to craft the two Soulcopper Tools, however they can also be used to craft the Soulcopper Block (the same way you'd craft any other ingot's block), which is also a light source! There are also other soulcopper block variants similar to the vanilla copper block variants, however those do not emit light.

### Soulcopper Pickaxe

Crafted by making a pickaxe out of Soulcopper Ingots, the Soulcopper Pickaxe is a fairly strong pickaxe with durability similar to diamond. It also has the ability to consume durability to place a light source on the ground, so you don't need to carry any torches with you when you are adventuring in the caves!

### Soulcopper Burner

The Soulcopper Burner is a tool used for quickly Oxidizing your Copper Blocks! It can be crafted by following the recipe below.

To use the burner, simply hold right-click on any Copper Block (including doors and trapdoors!) that can oxidize. The Soulcopper Burner will consume durability and oxidize the block! Make sure to shift-right click doors and trapdoors to avoid opening/closing them while you do so.
