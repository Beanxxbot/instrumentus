Welcome to the **Instrumentus** wiki

Here you can find detailed information on all of the features in the mod, configuring the mod, and information about contributing to the mod. I'm attempting to keep this wiki up to date with the features of Instrumentus as they are added - if there is missing information (and the update is not extremely recent) please let me know, and I'll be sure to get it updated.

The wiki is broken by feature-set, similarly to the configuration file of the mod itself.

Please note that this wiki will always be referring to the latest version of the mod.

## Contributing

Below you can find information on assisting in the development of Instrumentus

### Development & Pull Requests

As stated in the [README](https://github.com/Beanxxbot/instrumentus?tab=readme-ov-file#instrumentus), feature suggestions are welcome and can be submitted on the [Instrumentus Features Suggestions Page](https://github.com/Beanxxbot/instrumentus/discussions/categories/feature-suggestions) and I will consider them for addition in the mod. Any modifications to the mod made by someone other than myself or anyone directly on the team working on the mod must be made via pull-request into the respective MC Version's branch.

### Supported Versions & ModLoaders

Instrumentus' new features will always be working towards the current major version of Minecraft. At this point, backporting features is _not_ something that I personally will be undertaking. If someone is interested in assisting with the backporting of features, please contact me via Discord (beanxxbot), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/beanbot/projects), or directly here on GitHub.

Starting with version 1.20.4-2.4.2, Instrumentus will exclusively be releasing feature and Minecraft Version updates on NeoForge. Please do not ask me to port the mod to a later version of forge. I will consider PRs for later forge updates, please do not Fork and redistribute as a Forge mod, I would rather it all be included under the Instrumentus name. If someone is interested in regularly maintaining the forge version, feel free to reach out, but due to my feelings on the whole Forge-NeoForge situation, I'll only be working on NeoForge.

### Translations

Something I'd love to improve is the available languages that Instrumentus has! If you're interested in contributing to the translations of the mod, please submit a pull request. Currently we only have en-US implemented.
