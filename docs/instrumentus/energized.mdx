Energized Di-Emerald Tools are Instrumentus' attempt at Vanilla-esque tools that are powered by Energy. There is a variant of these tools for every single vanilla tool type, as well as all of the new tools added by Instrumentus that have multiple tool-materials. Energized Di-Emerald tools are intended to be late game tools, and any mod that can charge items with energy should be able to charge these. Instrumentus also adds a new tool, the Energized Di-Emerald Lightning Rod, that can be used to charge items (see more below). The tools hold 20,000 FE at a full charge, and consume 76 FE to do an action.

### Raw Materials

To craft Energized Di-Emerald Tools, you'll need two primary ingredients. The "ingot" for the tools is the Energized Di-Emerald Ingot, which can be crafted following the recipe below. When crafting any tool, you'll want to replace the sticks in the recipe with Carbon Rods, the recipe for which can also be found below.

Crafting tools with these materials will yield a tool that has no charge. You can either charge the tool with another mod that charges items with Energy, however a tool will also charge to full when struck by lightning. This includes a lightning strike on a lightning rod from vanilla Minecraft.

### Energized Di-Emerald Lightning Rod

The Energized Di-Emerald Lightning Rod can be crafting following the recipe below.

The tool has a unique ability to conjure lightning strikes, and does so by right clicking on a lightning rod block. This consumes 5,000 FE, and will cause a lightning bolt to spawn on the lightning rod block. You'll need to get your tool struck naturally by a lightning bolt at least once, and after that you can technically have infinite tool energy (if you make a second Energized Di-Emerald Lightning Rod).
