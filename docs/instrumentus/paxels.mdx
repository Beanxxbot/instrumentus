Paxels are an all-in-one gathering tool consisting of a pickaxe, axe, and shovel all in one convenient tool. To balance the tool somewhat, Paxels have the same durability as a single tool of that material-type.

### Materials

Currently, you can craft a Paxel using the following tool materials:
* Wood
* Stone
* [Copper](/mod/instrumentus/docs/coppertools)
* Iron
* Gold
* Diamond
* Netherite
* [Energized Di-Emerald](/mod/instrumentus/docs/energized)

### Crafting

Paxels can be crafted following the pattern below, replacing the diamond tools with same tools made of any of the materials listed above.

### Trivia!

Paxels were the first feature added to Instrumentus (fun fact, the mod was formerly called More Paxels), back in an era of Minecraft where Mekanism wasn't being updated fast enough, and I wanted Paxels in my game!
