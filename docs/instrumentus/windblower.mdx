The Wind Blower is a block that can be used to prevent Phantoms from spawning. When right clicked with an empty hand or with the Wind Blower's fuel, it will be bound to the player.

It is fueled by right clicking on the block with a Breeze Rod, and has four charges.

Each time phantoms are prevented from spawning, a sound effect and animation plays, and a charge is consumed.
