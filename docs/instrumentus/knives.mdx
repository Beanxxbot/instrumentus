Knives are a tool that have a single purpose - to harvest plant fibers from tall grass! These plant fibers can be used to craft string. This creates an easy and accessible way to get string early on in the game.

### Materials

Currently, you can craft a Knife using the following tool materials:
* Wood
* Stone
* [Copper](/mod/instrumentus/docs/coppertools)
* Iron
* Gold
* Diamond
* Netherite
* [Energized Di-Emerald](/mod/instrumentus/docs/energized)

### Crafting

Knives can be crafted following the pattern below, replacing the diamonds with any of the materials listed above. String can be crafted from plant fiber following the pattern below.

### Planned Features

In the future, I'd like to make the knife useful in other ways - as a weapon, and also as a tool. Please suggest ideas for this on the [Instrumentus Feature Discussion Page](https://github.com/Beanxxbot/instrumentus/discussions/categories/feature-suggestions)
